An attempt to implement the Reversi game using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/). In this project, instead of using canvas / svg for visualization, it only uses standard DOM elements such that `HTMLDivElement` and `HTMLSpanElement`. 

Goal of this project:

- Support both PC clients and mobile clients
- Use typescript, react, react-dom, redux to build a game
- Use css3 for basic animation effect (no Canvas / SVG)
- Use html5 Audio for sound effect
- Implement simple game solver using alphaâ€“beta pruning
- Support websocket base bi-directional communication (streatch)
